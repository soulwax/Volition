name: 'Other issues: Blank template'
about: For issues that are not a bug report or feature request

---

Consider using the Bug report or Feature request template. If it doesn't belong there, use this (empty) template. Make sure to provide enough details so it is clear for contributors to help you out. Premature or incomplete issues cannot be resolved due to lack of information or unclear descriptions.

Make sure your issue can be reproduced with the Engine and not by your own engine that you're creating alongside with Volition. For issues with your own engine, I am happy to help you in the [Imperial Cult Discord server](https://discord.gg/XNvEEkGFAB).
